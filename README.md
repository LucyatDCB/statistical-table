A statistical table is a method used to present statistical data by arranging the numbers systematically and describing some mass processes. This table can be seen as a representation of a subject and a predicate. The group of the phenomenon discussed in the table is the subject. The properties that describe the subject is the predicate. These tables consist of vertical columns and horizontal rows. The subject is entered in the rows of the table, while the predicate is entered in the columns. The column and row intersection form the cells. This is where the numerical data will be arrayed. The meaning of every number is given by the heading of the column and row.
